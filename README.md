# Svelte TypeScript project

src: file with App.svelte and project's components

Please, go there to check my homework: https://github.com/KHiMAeRA05/khimaera05.github.io/tree/Svelte_version/khimaera05.github.io/svelte-typescript-app/src
I can't create GitHub Pages with svelte for some reason.
# If you would like to see how does it looks like
Then download the branch and type follow commands using terminal:
```
cd .\khimaera05.github.io\svelte-typescript-app\
npm run build
npm run dev
```
Then just click the local host :)
